This a companion text for the course Evolutionary Computation of the Department of Informatics Engineering of the University of Coimbra. The course starts in 2006,  and we think it  is now time to compile the material presented to students in the form of simple notes. There are already some good general books on the subject of nature inspired computation (see \cite{Castro2006}, \cite{Floreano2008}, \cite{Brabazon2015}), so our aim is not to write another one. \\
